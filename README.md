# NeuralNetworkModel
#A basic neural network model by Hung

The exercise is divided into 3 parts:

- Part 1: initialization: include the function activation and derivative
- Part 2: class processing a model neural network: include calculate process and training with model
- Part 3: create/import input data; call the model to train,calculate and predict output; evaluate the model
